I obtained my PhD degree from the College of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University in March 2023, under the supervision of Professor Yin Zhang. During my studies, my research interests mainly included Commonsense Question Answering, Knowledge Fusion, and Explanation Generation for Large Language Models, and published several academic papers in ACL, IJCAI, CVPR, ACM MultiMedia, COLING, CIKM, etc. Currently, my research interests mainly focus on the reasoning and planning of large language models, AI Agent, World Models, and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning.
